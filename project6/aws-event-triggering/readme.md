This script is an automation for configuring an AWS S3 bucket with a Lambda function that triggers an SNS topic. The SNS topic sends a notification to a specified email address when a new object is added to the S3 bucket.o

Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

The AWS account ID is retrieved and stored in a variable.
The AWS region, S3 bucket name, Lambda function name, IAM role name, and email address are all set.
An IAM role is created with policies attached to it to provide necessary permissions for the Lambda function and SNS topic.
The role's ARN is extracted and stored in a variable.
Permissions for the role are attached to allow Lambda full access and SNS full access.
An S3 bucket is created, and the output is stored in a variable.
A file is uploaded to the S3 bucket.
A zip file is created to upload the Lambda function code.
A Lambda function is created with the specified parameters.
Permissions are added to allow the S3 bucket to invoke the Lambda function.
An S3 event trigger is set up to trigger the Lambda function when an object is created in the specified bucket.
An SNS topic is created, and the topic's ARN is stored in a variable.
A subscription is added to the topic to send notifications to the specified email address.
A message is published to the SNS topic with details of the created S3 bucket.
The script has comments for each command and variable, making it easy to understand what each line is doing. It automates the process of setting up a Lambda function and SNS topic for S3 bucket events, which can be useful for automating notifications for new files being added to a bucket.
